Warcraft III Library is a collection of libraries for Blizzard's "Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos" and "Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne" file formats.
Additionally there is some useful applications and World Editor emulation libraries.
Please consider that this version is NEITHER stable NOR usable yet!
Check out http://wc3lib.org for further information.

Define environment variable "WC3_DIR" to the Warcraft III directory to make some Unit Tests work.
