For all available compile flags/options configure via cmake please and you'll get all options with their corresponding descriptions.
To build the wc3lib change into the wc3lib directory and run:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make -j4

Run "make -j4 install" if you want to install the program.

Specify the options in CMake to reduce the dependencies and modules which are built. For example you can build the core module only without any GUI.
Therefore the build won't require Qt5 anymore.

Requirements (actual used versions, of course you could use others which are compliant with these):
Boost 1.58 (components: system filesystem serialization program_options iostreams unit_test_framework timer)

for BLP flag only:
jpeg 8d or libjpeg-turbo 1.2.1

for MPQ flag only:
