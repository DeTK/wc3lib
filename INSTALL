For all available compile flags/options configure via cmake please and you'll get all options with their corresponding descriptions.
To build the wc3lib change into the wc3lib directory and run:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make -j4

Run "make -j4 install" if you want to install the program.

Specify the options in CMake to reduce the dependencies and modules which are built. For example you can build the core module only without any GUI.
Therefore the build won't require Qt5 anymore.

Requirements (actual used versions, of course you could use others which are compliant with these):
Boost 1.58 (components: system filesystem serialization program_options iostreams unit_test_framework timer)

for BLP flag only:
jpeg 8d or libjpeg-turbo 1.2.1

for MPQ flag only:
bzip2 1.0.6-r3 (Boost support)
zlib 1.2.5-r2 (Boost support)

for EDITOR and the corresponding plugin flags only:
qt5-qtbase-devel 5.6.1-3
qt5-qtgui-devel 5.6.1-3
qt5-qtmultimedia-devel 5.6.1-3
kf5-kio-devel 5.25.0-1
OGRE 1.9.0

for DOC flag only:
Doxygen 1.8.10

Don't forget to place "ogre.cfg" and "plugins.cfg" files into working directory of editor application or to configure the installed files in /etc/wc3lib.
The contain graphics driver information required by OGRE. Otherwise the 3D display won't work.

Windows Builds:
* CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Release, to prevent too big files as well.
* Don't use MDLX (32 bit error too big files) and don't use JASS. Use 64 bit libraries of Qt5 and the cygwin 64 bit GCC compiler.
* Compile Boost libraries using gcc which uses the Cygwin compiler.
* Use Qt libraries from Cygwin as well. Qt5Core_DIR E:/cygwin/lib/cmake/Qt5Core
* Either use "C:/Qt/Tools/mingw530_32/bin/mingw32-make.exe" as Make program or use the one of Cygwin but then you have to use Bash as shell which cannot be set for CMake.
* Symbolic link E:\cygwin\usr\lib to E:\cygwin\lib, otherwise CMake does not find the files.
* For MinGW: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/more/getting_started/windows.html
* In the cygwin Bash: export PATH="/cygdrive/c/Qt/Tools/mingw530_32/bin/:$PATH"
* Make sure that the correct GCC is chosen: which gcc.exe
* Correct: ./b2.exe -j4 toolset=gcc --with-iostreams -s BZIP2_SOURCE=E:/Projekte/wc3lib/windows/bzip2-1.0.6 -s ZLIB_SOURCE=E:/Projekte/wc3lib/windows/zlib-1.2.8 stage
* Then: ./b2.exe -j4 toolset=gcc stage
* Then replace cyg by lib?
* ./b2.exe -j4 toolset=gcc stage --with-iostreams -s BZIP2_SOURCE=E:\Projekte\wc3lib\windows\bzip2-1.0.6 -s ZLIB_SOURCE=E:\Projekte\wc3lib\windows\zlib-1.2.8
* ./b2.exe -j4 toolset=gcc stage --with-iostreams -s BZIP2_BINARY=libbz2 -s BZIP2_INCLUDE=/cygdrive/e/Projekte/wc3lib/windows/include -s BZIP2_LIBPATH=/cygdrive/e/Projekte/wc3lib/windows/lib -s ZLIB_BINARY=zlib -s ZLIB_INCLUDE=/cygdrive/e/Projekte/wc3lib/windows/include -s ZLIB_LIBPATH=/cygdrive/e/Projekte/wc3lib/windows/lib (--build-type=complete --layout=tagged) The cyg prefix has to be removed afterwards.
* Use "E:\Projekte\boost_1_61_0\stage\lib" as Boost_LIBRARYDIR
